# Bike & Bike By-Products Sales Report - Power BI Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of bike and bike by-products sales across the US and worldwide. The report is created using **Power BI**, an industry-leading business intelligence tool that allows users to visualize data, build dashboards, and generate insights from large datasets with ease.

## About Power BI

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a business analytics service by Microsoft that enables users to:
- Connect to hundreds of data sources.
- Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- Create visualizations and reports that provide insights.
- Share insights across an organization or embed them in an app or website.

With its interactive dashboards and rich data connectivity options, Power BI is widely used for data analysis, reporting, and business decision-making.

## Project Scope

The objective of this project is to analyze the sales of bikes and related products, tracking sales performance over time and across different regions. The analysis aims to answer key questions such as:
- What are the top-performing products in the bike category?
- Which regions have the highest sales growth?
- What are the trends in bike and by-product sales over the years?

The Power BI dashboard includes visualizations such as:
- Sales trends over time.
- Sales breakdown by regions (US vs. worldwide).
- Product category performance.
- Revenue comparisons and forecast insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains:
- **Two dimension tables**:
  1. `Customers`: Information about customers such as location and demographics.
  2. `Products`: Information about the different types of bikes and bike-related products.
  
- **Two fact tables**:
  1. `Sales`: Sales transactions, including date, product, and quantity sold.
  2. `Inventory`: Stock levels for bikes and by-products.

- **One metric table**: 
  - `Metrics`: This table contains pre-calculated metrics such as sales revenue, profit margin, and new variables created for analysis purposes (e.g., sales growth, region-wise performance indicators).
